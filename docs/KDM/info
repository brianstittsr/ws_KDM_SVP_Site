Hi Brian, and Nel,

Can V+ build a landing page for our promotion

https://singularityit.io/partners/kdm-associates

Keith Moore | MBDA Federal Procurement Center 

Hi Nel,

Yes 

The Landing pages will be used to send to our cohort candidates, to our Conference attendees, integrated webinar notifications, and webinars promoting the Consortium.

The www.IAEOZsummit.com is a KDM Event Management Page ideally developed to shift our consortium content and mission to the KDM Event Management Platform.  The site was designed to promote multiple events, design information channels, and hyper media size our multimedia, social mediums.  

It is a platform that will accept registration, sponsors, and make payments for services rendered to give the user a full online experience, preparing our client, our customers, and our collaborators a full spectrum of information on demand. 

When would be a good time for Logicore, E3S, and V+ 
to meet. and discuss and codify the execution of next steps.   

I am in discussions with QME. At this time, they have indicated to have no interest in the Consortium, and wish for KDM to bring them project they would be more inclined to engage in.

I have added Pam Ramos who has supported our contract compliance and assists with proposal development.  If anyone has any questions, please email me.  

I had another 2-hour meeting with SBA.  SBA has a high priority, and we are leading by example and as such, I would ask that each consortium member continue to do all to "give and get."


Thank you, 

Happy Holidays

Thank you, Keith.

We will set up a system of linked landing pages, shopping carts, email/texting sequences, notifications, and automations, and whatever else we can think of yp excellent user and admin experiencees.

Apologies for the previous prematurely sent email . . . I hit an errant button while correcting grammar and spelling. I hope the message came through okay, though.

Thank you for your understanding.

All good wishes.

Hi, Brian.

I will be with family this week, but will be checking my email. Please let me know your thoughts about the attached three documents related to our relationship with KDM/Miranda/Esteven. Do you think they are reasonable and viable in theory? Or are there major improvements/changes you would suggest?

I'd like your input before sharing with Roy and Dave.

Thank you so much!

Nel

V+ KDM ConsortiumPrivate + Government OpportunitiesBusiness and Marketing Plan BriefPurpose / MissionBuild a vetted ecosystem of small/medium companies that can win more government andcommercial contracts by combining (1) opportunity identification, (2) best-fit team assemblyfrom qualified members, (3) proposal writing + orchestration, and (4) buyer access pathways.What we sell (core value proposition)A “team-to-win” engine: the Consortium curates opportunities, assembles the best team frommembers, runs a repeatable capture + proposal workflow, and creates credible pathways to meetand be seen by buyers (government and commercial).Target customers (members)Small/medium businesses (10–200 employees typical) with relevant capabilities and some pastperformance, but inconsistent access to opportunities, teaming, and proposal bandwidth. Priorityverticals: logistics, cyber/zero trust, IT/data, training, engineering, energy resilience,manufacturing services/support.Demand-side (buyers & partners)Agencies and procurement organizations (DoD/logistics, DOE/energy resilience,USACE/infrastructure), primes seeking qualified subs, and commercial buyers/OEM ecosystemsneeding vetted suppliers/services.Offer & pricing (starting point)• Core Capture Member: $1,750/month (launch target)Includes: opportunity matching + best-fit team assembly, orchestration (kickoff, roles,compliance matrix, schedule), concierge support, and proposal support credits(recommended: defined monthly cap) plus access to buyer briefings/showcases.• Pursuit Packs (add-ons): priced per pursuit to fund heavier proposals (standard/complexresponses, multiple volumes, pricing narratives, rapid turnarounds).• Additional revenue: event ticketing (in-platform), sponsorships, training/micro-courses.How we deliver (operating model)1. Weekly opportunity triage → publish “pursuit briefs” (member-only intelligence).
2. Member qualification system (capability brief + 3 past performance snapshots +compliance badges).3. Team assembly rules (objective fit: relevance, capacity, compliance, location, buyerproximity).4. Proposal factory workflow (intake → outline/compliance → draft → red team →submit → debrief).5. Buyer access pathways: monthly buyer briefings, quarterly showcases, partner-enabledintros, targeted outreach.Platform (digital infrastructure)KDM-branded portal powered by V+ with: onboarding + billing, searchable member directory,opportunity board + pursuit workspaces, event ticketing, sponsor workflows, resource library,role-based admin, reporting.Go-to-market plan (first 6 months)• Month 1: onboard 5 founding members, publish first pursuit briefs, run first buyerbriefing.• Months 2–3: grow to 10–15 members; launch 1–2 pursuits/month using standardizedworkflow; start sponsorship outreach.• Months 4–6: reach ~30 members; run monthly buyer briefings + first quarterlyshowcase; expand pursuits to 3–6/month.KPIs (scoreboard)• Members: onboarding completion rate, retention, participation in pursuits• Pipeline: qualified opportunities/month, pursuits launched, on-time submission rate• Buyer engagement: briefings hosted, buyer attendance, meetings scheduled• Outcomes: seats at table (IDIQ/on-ramps), wins, debrief quality• Economics: MRR, pursuit pack revenue, support capacity utilizationRisk controls (best practices)• Define included concierge + proposal credits; use pursuit packs for heavy lifts• Document team selection criteria (avoid pay-to-play perception)• Per-pursuit teaming agreements + NDAs; debrief capture to build future wins
• Do not promise awards; promise process, access pathways, and execution

Dear Keith,
Thank you for sharing these IAEOZ Summit clips and for taking the time to provide the deeper context behind your meeting with Major General Nick Justice. The clarity you’ve drawn from those conversations—and the way you are connecting bipartisan manufacturing legislation, workforce, innovation, national defense, critical minerals, and U.S. manufacturing into one cohesive mission—lands with conviction.
I also would like to acknowledge the strength of the direction you outlined for 2026. Your intent for KDM to spend less time selling and convincing, and more time leveraging years of proven Federal sector experience to build strategic partnerships—assembling the right people with unquestionable talent and capabilities to execute a “Whole of Government Total Team Approach”—is precisely the posture a serious consortium must take if we are to serve the Defense Industrial Base with credibility and results.
From the V+ perspective, we are aligned with this vision and prepared to contribute in meaningful, practical ways as the 2026 digital platform takes form—especially where the market is demanding trusted guidance that converts complex requirements into clear, realistic, and achievable steps. Specifically, V+ can enrich the platform and program by:
Translating manufacturing, supplier readiness, and capacity-building requirements into action-oriented frameworks and “ready-to-use” resources;
Helping design and deliver CMMC Level I and II education pathways that are understandable, trackable, and tied to measurable readiness outcomes;
Curating and packaging conference, webinar, summit, and workshop content into digestible video assets, articles, podcasts, and high-value multimedia social media stories that build confidence and momentum; and
Dovetailing our manufacturing vertical expertise with the consortium’s national priorities and marketplace strategy so that “What Works” becomes the consistent standard we demonstrate, not just the message we promote.
I agree that scheduling the integration discussion with QME on Tuesday is timely and important—particularly to ensure we are intentional about how www.iaeozsummit.com and the KDM activities content are woven together into a unified platform experience for registrants, sponsors, media partners, and participating organizations. If you would like, I can come prepared with suggestions related to:
The platform functions required to educate, engage, empower, and track participants;
The initial program tracks and vertical priorities; and
The content-to-engagement flow that turns events into sustained participation, capability building, and measurable outcomes for manufacturers and federal contractors.
Thank you again, Keith. The culture you’re defining—committed to instructing, empowering, and building confidence—sets the standard for what trusted advisors should be. I’m honored and happy to be a contributor to the consortium as we enter 2026.
Respectfully, 
Nel

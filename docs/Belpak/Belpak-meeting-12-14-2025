VIEW RECORDING: https://fathom.video/share/nNGpBcxexxyrQfASe8VseXi25uv2QGwN
Meeting Purpose

Align on client strategy and new partnership opportunities.

Key Takeaways

  - Bellpack Meeting Strategy: For the upcoming meeting with Bellpack's Chief HR Officer, the strategy is to pivot from the SOW to the Wellness Plan's financial benefits, using a "recruiting at competitors" tactic to attract talent.
  - New Partnership Model: A new partnership model is emerging, bundling services (gov't contracting, CMMC readiness, automation) to create a comprehensive package. This model will be replicated for private OEMs (e.g., Toyota Battery) to vet their supply chains.
  - Wellness Plan Value: The plan's value is being reframed around reducing employee "friction" to boost productivity and deliver significant ROI via tax savings (~$640/yr/employee) and lower insurance premiums.
  - Xenthium's True Scale: Xenthium's capabilities are far more substantial than previously known (15+ yrs old, 10k+ installations, 40 engineers), including a new contract with the 5th largest auto company.

Topics

Internal Team & EOS Update

  - The executive team (Nelinia, Dave McFarland, Brian Stitz, Roy) is meeting in Palm Springs for its annual EOS strategic session.
  - Brian Stitz (CTO): Excelling with a strong process mindset; Nelinia will schedule bi-weekly 1:1s.
  - Roy (Sales Funnels): Lacks clear process documentation, a key concern for Nelinia.
  - Dave McFarland (COO): Actively engaging associates for value-add ideas and collaborating with Brian on Mattermost automation.
  - Website Content: "Case studies" will be renamed "hypotheticals" to ensure accuracy. Dave will ask affiliates for real case studies.

Bellpack Meeting Strategy

  - Context: Henry Hicks invited Dawn Statsney (Chief HR Officer, Bellpack) to the meeting, shifting the focus from the SOW.
  - Strategy: Pivot the conversation to the Wellness Plan's financial benefits.
      - Recruiting Tactic: Use the "traffic" app to place targeted employment ads inside competitor facilities, attracting experienced talent.

      - Financial ROI:
          - Tax Savings: ~$640/employee/year.

      - Vision: Develop a proprietary "V-plus Certification" to vet OEM supply chains, creating a new, scalable service line.
      - Requirement: Secure legal protection for this IP.

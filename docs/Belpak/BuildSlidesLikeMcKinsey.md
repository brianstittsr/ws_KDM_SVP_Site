--- Chunk 1 (3bf9f33e-b830-439d-a9cf-d591981d67e3_How to build slides like McKinsey (the easy way).mp3) ---
00:00 - 00:02: Building slides like McKinsey is actually really easy.
00:02 - 00:04: I'm a PowerPoint instructor for the consulting industry,
00:04 - 00:07: and I'm telling you all you have to do is follow the movie framework.
00:07 - 00:08: First, decide on a message.
00:08 - 00:12: If I'm making a slide about Spotify's growth, I'll put that right in the title.
00:12 - 00:14: Second, organize your slide.
00:14 - 00:16: Think of all the supporting data you can for your message
00:16 - 00:18: and categorize them into two or three groups.
00:18 - 00:20: Then, remove whatever doesn't fit.
00:20 - 00:22: Third, visualize your information.
00:22 - 00:24: See if you can take one or two of those categories
00:24 - 00:27: and turn it into a chart or some sort of visual that explains it better.
00:27 - 00:30: Fourth is the most important step, and it's calling out the insight.
00:30 - 00:32: There's a couple different ways to do this.
00:32 - 00:34: The first is to state your insights directly.
00:34 - 00:35: Don't just say the category name.
00:35 - 00:38: Tell your audience exactly what you want them to know.
00:38 - 00:40: And the second part of this is to highlight the insights
00:40 - 00:44: with bolding, colors, texts, arrows, callouts, whatever you need.
00:44 - 00:46: The fifth and final step is to worry about the extras.
00:46 - 00:48: This is all the little stuff you don't usually think about,
00:48 - 00:50: like aligning your text in your boxes
00:50 - 00:53: to make sure everything on your slide is organized and neat.
00:53 - 00:54: Follow this framework, and I promise you,
00:54 - 00:56: soon enough, you'll be building slides like a pro.

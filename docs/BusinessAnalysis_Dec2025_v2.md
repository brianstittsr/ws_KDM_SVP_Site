```
**Status:** Well-implemented with remember-me, error handling, and automatic team member linking.

### Onboarding Experience ⚠️
```
Sign Up → Account Type Selection → [Client: /onboarding/client] OR [Affiliate: /portal]
```
**Status:** Client onboarding path exists but may be incomplete. No guided tour or progressive disclosure.

   - **Status:** ✅ Complete

## Conclusion

Strategic Value+ has a **solid technical foundation** and **comprehensive feature set** for its target market. The primary gaps are in **monetization infrastructure** (no payments), **growth tooling** (no analytics), and **user engagement features** (no email notifications, limited onboarding). 

The platform is **ready for beta users** but needs payment integration before commercial launch. The recommended path is:
1. Add analytics immediately to understand user behavior
2. Implement Stripe within 2 weeks
3. Launch with a simple pricing model
4. Iterate based on user feedback

**Estimated time to revenue-ready:** 2-3 weeks of focused development.

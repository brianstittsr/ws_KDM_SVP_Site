## Step 4: User Journey Mapping

### Authentication Flow ✅
```
Landing Page → Sign Up (3 account types) → Firebase Auth → Team Member Linking → Portal
                                                                    ↓
Sign In → Firebase Auth → Team Member Check → Portal/Command Center
```

### Onboarding Experience ⚠️
- **Affiliates**: Direct to portal (no onboarding)
- **Strategic Partners**: Direct to portal (no onboarding)

          "In an exciting development for the large Prime Government Contractors community, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) network, and small, emerging, and Minority Business Enterprises (MBEs) across the country, the MBDA Federal Procurement Center (FPC) is officially transitioning its operations to KDM & Associates, LLC.",
          "This transition marks a strategic realignment, bringing new leadership, fresh initiatives, and stronger partnerships to better support the escalating demand for shovel-ready, small and emerging businesses to address the Nation's supply chain requirements. Historical data confirms that small and minority owned businesses have consistently faced barriers to entry in the Federal acquisition sector. As such, the Federal Procurement Center's suite of Government contracting support services will remain accessible, but with an even greater focus on empowering – through intense capacity building, mentorship, and defined support services to achieve sustainable success.",

KDM is renowned for providing strategic teaming, and building capacity for small and mid sized businesses.
